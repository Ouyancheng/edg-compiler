cfe_daemon_common.h -- Common code for the C++/C front end daemon
                       (cfe_daemon.c) and its corresponding client
                       (cfe_daemon_client.c).

This file is provided as an example of using the front end as a library to
build a multi-threaded client/server C++/C compiler front end.

/*
Protocol Documentation

The daemon protocol operates over Unix domain sockets.  The daemon binds and
listens to a two-way socket located at the path computed by
allocating_socket_file_name (see this function for more information about the
exact path of the socket).

The daemon protocol uses a series of bytes (the end_of_message_bytes) below to
delimit the end of messages.  For the purpose of brevity, when this
documentation states that the client or daemon "sends a message containing X"
that means the respective program sends the bytes "X" followed by the
end_of_message_bytes to signal the end of the message.

Clients begin using the daemon by first connecting and then sending a message
containing the daemon level command they would like execute.

1. Ping Command

   The ping daemon command is a very simple command for testing whether the
   socket, and thus daemon, is still alive (and not implemented in
   cfe_daemon_client.c).  This command avoids the added weight and complexity
   of using a front end invocation to test whether the daemon is still alive.
   It is particularly useful for software that queues work to be executed by
   the daemon and needs to keep tabs on whether it's still running (e.g., a
   test driver).

   1. The client immediately upon connecting sends a message containing the
      ping_request_bytes.
   2. The daemon accepts this, sends nothing back, and closes the socket.
   3. The client closes its socket.

2. Exec Command

   This command is used to execute the front end (and is what is implemented by
   cfe_daemon_client.c).

   1. The client immediately upon connecting sends a message containing the
      exec_request_bytes.
   2. If built using DEBUG: the client then sends a message containing the
      translation unit tag (see trans_unit_tag in cfe_daemon.c for more
      information).
   3. The client sends a message containing the number of front end command
      line arguments (i.e., the argc value for EDG_MAIN) as a
      textually-represented integer followed by a null terminator.  This is
      then followed (in the same message) by n null-terminated strings (one per
      command line argument).
   4. The daemon then invokes the front end and sends a message containing the
      textual output of the front end invocation (i.e., what would in most
      conventional configurations be printed to stderr).
   5. The daemon then sends a message containing the textually-represented exit
      code and closes the socket.
   6. The client closes its socket.
