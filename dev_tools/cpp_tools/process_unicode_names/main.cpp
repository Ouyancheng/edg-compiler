/*
Utility program that creates a C/C++ source file containing a finite state
machine for recognizing a Unicode character name and determining its
associated code point.  The input data is taken from two files.  The first
is assumed to be in the form of the file

  https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt

where each line consists of

  <code point>;<name or category>;...

"code point" is four to six hexadecimal digits giving the numeric value of
the associated character.  "name or category" is either the name of a
Unicode character (consisting solely of the characters 0-9, A-Z, hyphen,
and the space character) or a category name enclosed in angle brackets,
such as "<control>".  The names and code points of the lines in the first
category are added to the state machine.  Some pairs of lines in the second
category define a range of characters, e.g.,

  4E00;<CJK Ideograph, First>;...
  9FFF;<CJK Ideograph, Last>;...

Characters in the ranges for the CJK and Tangut ideographs, along with the
Hangul syllables, are also added to the machine.

The second file is assumed to be in the form of the file

  https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/NameAliases.txt

which consists of empty lines, comment lines beginning with '#', and data
lines of the form

  <code point>;<name>;<category>

where "code point" and "name" are as in the first file.  The names and code
points from data lines whose category is "correction", "control", or
"alternate" are added to the state machine; all other lines are ignored.

The state machine is initially created as a collection of linked a_state,
a_transition, and a_code_point_range objects, as defined below.  Once the
state machine is complete, it is flatterned into a byte array that will be
used as data by the front end to process named Unicode escapes.  See the
comments inserted into the generated output file for a description of the
format and contents of the flattened state machine.

Definition of a state object.  There are three kinds of states in the state
machine: terminal states, range states, and intermediate states.  Terminal
states have a single terminal transition, i.e., a transition for the
character '}' that gives the code point for the (single) character whose
name is matched by the current state.  A range state is like a terminal
state except that it has no transitions but directly represents multiple
code points (all the code points in the associated ranges, with names
generated algorithmically from the value of the corresponding code point).
Intermediate states have one or more transitions that lead to other states
