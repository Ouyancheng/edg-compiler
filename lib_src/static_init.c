files that use the needed destruction list to be linked with
older object files, the "patch" and "munch" style destruction lists
are also supported.  If a file contains both a list of needed
destructions and a "patch" or "munch" list, the "patch"/"munch" list
is processed first, followed by the needed destruction list.  This
ensures that any new needed destructions created while processing
the "patch"/"munch" destructions will be handled.
